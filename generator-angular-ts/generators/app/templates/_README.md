<%= description =>

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
 - on (apt-based) Linux use `sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs nodejs-legacy`.
 - on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
 - on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

2. Install these NPM packages globally

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g bower gulp nodemon
    ```

    >If you don't want use sudo here, refer to these [instructions on how to not require sudo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md).

3. Install/Update Supporting libraries 

 - from within the project directory, use bower & npm to install support libraries:

    ```bash
	bower install
    npm install
    ```


## Installing on Jenkins CI Server

If you are using Jenkins for CI (using Nicta's Docker images), you can integrate this application by modifying the Docker file (probably stored on github in a project under [Tim Murphy's repo](https://github.inside.nicta.com.au/tmurphy/)).

1. Update apt-get commands to include Nodejs
  - Initially, the file will look something like this:
    ```bash
	RUN apt-get update && apt-key update && apt-get clean && \
    echo "replace this line with extra packages, if necessary"
	```

  - Add apt-get commands to install nodejs like this:
    ```bash
	RUN apt-get update && apt-key update && apt-get clean && \
	apt-get install -y nodejs nodejs-legacy npm    
	```
  
2. Use NPM to install bower, gulp and nodemon
  - Ensure you are in a ```USER root``` block, perhaps directly after
    the apt-get command, and add the following line to install node packages:

	```bash
	RUN npm install -g bower gulp nodemon
	```

## Quick start

### Running in dev mode
 - serve the project using express with `gulp serve-dev`

### Build release version
 - build optimised version with `gulp build`



## Gulp options

### Linting
 - Run code analysis using `gulp ts-lint`.

### Static Analysis
 - Run plato using `gulp plato`.
 - View report at './report/plato/index.html'

### Tests
 - Run the unit tests using `gulp test` (via karma).

### Run the build code
 - Run the optimize project from the build folder with `gulp serve-build`

- Build process is currently functional, but needing work. Also, please backport any changes
  back to the [angular-ts starter project](https://github.inside.nicta.com.au/tsimon/angular-ts).

### Help
 - Run `gulp help` to get a full list of tasks and options


# Project Structure

The analytics website is an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) project, implemented using [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The general code structure is:

	/src
		/client
			/app
				/components - reusable components
					/profiling - profiling of functions
					/routes - route handler
					/simple-grid - custom grid display. Not sure if this is worth maintaining
					/stacktrace - gets stacktraces
				/layout - overall page shell (not very interesting)
				/pages - routes and controllers for site pages
				/typings - typescript type definitions. Doesn't really belong here.
			/style - less files
			/templates - autogenerated angular template cache file
